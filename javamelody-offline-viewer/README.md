View reports on data offline without access to online reports.

If you don't have access to the online reports of javamelody on the running server,
or if you want to view the aggregated data of several instances of an application and you don't use the optional collect server,
or if you want to view the reports but the server is no longer running,
or if you want some pdf reports and you have not included the [iText dependency](../../../wiki/UserGuide#dependencies),
then the offline viewer may be for you in a degraded mode.

See [doc](../../../wiki/UserGuideAdvanced#offline-viewer)
